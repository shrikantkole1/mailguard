## 🎙️ ANALYZING A PHISHING EMAIL (1:15 - 2:00)

Let's test a real phishing attack.

[PAUSE - Click "Phishing" button]

This email claims to be from PayPal, but notice the sender: "paypal-one-verify-dot-com" — that's typosquatting.

The subject line screams urgency: "URGENT: Verify your account immediately."

Classic phishing tactics.

[PAUSE - Click "Analyze Email"]

Watch MailGuard work.

In the background, four specialized AI tools run in parallel:

✓ Scanning domain reputation...  
✓ Analyzing URL patterns...  
✓ Running attachment forensics...  
✓ Detecting social engineering...

[PAUSE - Wait for results]

**Eighty-seven risk score. Classification: MALICIOUS.**

MailGuard detected typosquatting, shortened URLs, and fear-based manipulation tactics.

Recommended action: Quarantine and block sender.

---

## 🎙️ EXECUTION TRACE (2:00 - 2:25)

But here's where MailGuard shines: **full transparency**.

Every tool that ran, what it found, and how long it took.

[PAUSE - Scroll to trace]

Domain reputation check: "Typosquatting detected" — four hundred twenty-one milliseconds.

URL scanner: "Shortened URL redirects to suspicious domain" — three hundred eighty-two milliseconds.

File forensics: "No attachments present" — six hundred fifty-four milliseconds.

Social engineering detector: "Urgency plus fear tactics detected" — two hundred thirty-four milliseconds.

Perfect for compliance audits and SOC investigations.

## 🎙️ QUICK ACTIONS (2:25 - 2:40)

Take action instantly.

Block the sender's IP. Run a WHOIS lookup. Export the full security report as JSON.

[PAUSE - Hover over buttons]

Or rescan with one click — now powered by the live backend.

[PAUSE - Click Export]

Done. Your security report is ready.
